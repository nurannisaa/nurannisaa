## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Annisa! ðŸ‘‹
### âœ¨ About Me âœ¨

I am graduated from Bandung Institute of Technology with Bachelor's degree and now working as a consultant assistant focused in the irrigation sector. Currently, I'm trying to expand my knowledge and upgrade my skills by learning data science. I really enjoy the process of working with data and exploring new things from the process of analyzing data. I await the opportunity to work as a data scientist and do more cool stuff in the future!

I publish my personal project related to data science here. If you find anything odd in my publications or you have any suggestions for me, kindly contact me directly ðŸ˜„
