### Hi, I'm Annisa! ï¿½ðŸ‘‹
## About Me ðŸ˜„
I am graduated from Bandung Institute of Technology majoring in Water Resources Engineering and Management. I am currently working as a consultant assistant working in the irrigation sector. Somehow I really enjoy working with data and I'm currently studying data science in general. 

I publish my personal project here. If you find anything wrong in my publications or you have any suggestions for me, please kindly inform me :)
